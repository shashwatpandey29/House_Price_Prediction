# üè† House Price Prediction using Machine Learning üß†

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features from a dataset. It includes a simple web-based interface using Flask, allowing users to input house details and receive predictions.

## üåü Introduction
Buying a house is one of the biggest investments, and predicting house prices accurately can greatly assist buyers and sellers. This project builds models to predict house prices using a dataset that includes multiple features such as lot area, year built, basement area, and more. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R¬≤).

## üìä Dataset
The dataset contains several features used to predict the house sale price, including:
1. **MSSubClass**: Type of dwelling (e.g., Single-family, duplex).
2. **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
3. **OverallCond**: Overall condition of the house (rating).
4. **YearBuilt**: Year the house was originally built.
5. **YearRemodAdd**: Year of last remodeling.
6. **BsmtFinSF2**: Finished square footage of the basement.
7. **TotalBsmtSF**: Total square footage of the basement.
8. **SalePrice**: Sale price of the house (target variable).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Elangovan0101/House-price-prediction.git
    cd House-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage
After the installation, you can run the Flask app and use the web interface to make predictions.

1. **Run the Flask app**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Navigate to the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
   - Enter house details in the form and click "Predict" to see the predicted house price.

## ü§ñ Models Used
The following machine learning models are trained on the dataset:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A regression model that works well for small datasets.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that fits multiple decision trees and averages the results for better accuracy.
3. **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model for predicting continuous values.
4. **CatBoost Regressor**: A high-performance boosting model specifically designed for categorical data.

## üìà Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared (R¬≤)**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that the model can explain.
